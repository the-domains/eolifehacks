eolifehacks? What is that? eolifehacks stands for Essential Oil life hacks. Almost 2 years ago, I was introduced to Essential Oils. I had never heard of them before that time. 

My husband had just retired from his 35 year career as an Air Traffic Controller. He took a couple of months off. Then he started school to become a Licensed Massage Therapist. 

He became interested in Massage Therapy and learned the value of de-stressing early in his controller career. Some people are born to be Massage Therapist. I believe my husband is one of those people. He has been very good at this for as long as I have know him.  Since the early days of our marriage when our five boys were young, they all knew Dad gave the best back massages and this was often part of their wind down ritual at the end of their day. 

As he progressed in school, we were talking one day and he was telling me about all the different oils that people were using. Some would use cream, some would use oils. He said he preferred oil, except he did not like the heaviness of the oils and neither did his clients. He wanted an oil that would absorb into the skin without leaving an oily feeling. I offered to research and see what others were using, and that is where I first begin learning about Essential Oils. 

What I found out was intriguing to say the least. There were carrier oils and essential oils and they were not the same. Carrier oils, such as Jojoba, grape seed, or olive, are what massage therapists normally use. I didn't know there was a difference between store bought essential oils and pure essential oils. I learned that all essential oils are not made the same. Some contain contaminates. Some are diluted. Sometimes even the aromas are not the same. It was confusing to say the least. I tried all of the carrier oils and essential oils I came across, looking for one that would be the perfect one to use, one that would not be greasy, would absorb quickly, and provide a great glide. 

I ended up liking Fractionated Coconut Oil the best and adding the essential oils for specific reasons. In my opinion, Fractionated Coconut Oil is good because, it is odorless, doesn't stain your clothes or linens, has a great glide, and absorbs into the skin without leaving a greasy feeling. 

I also learned about the amazing benefits of essential oils. Because Fractionated Coconut Oil is odorless, you can add what ever essential oil you need depending on what benefit you are looking for. 

This site is about the amazing benefits of Essential Oils, and how they can help you and your family. In fact they are so amazing, I refer to them as life hacks. And that is how EOlifeHacks was born. If you have ever had an mind-blowing experience with essential oils then you know what I mean. If you haven't then this site is a good place to start.
